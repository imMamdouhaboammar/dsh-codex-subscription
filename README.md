# DSH Codex Subscription

**Use your ChatGPT / Codex subscription directly in DeepSeek Harness**

*Authored by Mamdouh Aboammar*

No OpenAI API key or Codex CLI. Models, search, quota, and image generation stay inside DSH.

</p>

## Three-step start

1. **Install the plugin.** Run the standard DSH bundle command:

   ```sh
   dsh plugin --profile web add @mamdouh-aboammar/dsh-codex-subscription
   ```

2. **Sign in.** Restart DSH yourself, open **Settings -> Codex**, and choose browser sign-in. No Codex CLI and no pasted token are required.
3. **Use Codex.** Select a Codex model. Quota, subscription search, image generation, and Fast mode remain inside DSH.

DSH-Portable exposes the same standard plugin command, so the command above also applies there. See below for the complete official npm, update, and uninstall routes.

## Why this plugin

| Capability | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| **Subscription models** | Sign in to ChatGPT and use Codex without an OpenAI API key or Codex CLI |
| **Recoverable and diagnosable** | Sign-in state reconciles automatically; failed reads can be retried in place, while timeouts and stale account responses cannot overwrite current state; Settings can create a support report without credentials or account identifiers |
| **Visible quota** | Keep backend-provided standard Codex, Spark, and other limits separate |
| **Composer quota** | Choose a compact percentage, progress bar, or no inline quota display |
| **Safe quota reset** | See each reset credit separately and deliberately try one with a cooldown and acknowledgement |
| **Subscription search** | Explicitly route search globally through DSH default search or the signed-in Codex subscription |
| **Codex image generation and editing (Beta)** | Generate without references, or explicitly edit one selected image; preview, zoom, annotate regions, download the original, and get the original host path for new or edited images |
| **Fast mode** | Switch between Standard and Fast directly in the composer |
| **Model-aware context** | Keep catalog defaults, use each model's supported extended window, or enter a full numeric token limit for each model; Settings refreshes the model directory on open, account changes, and connection resets without overwriting an unsaved draft |
| **Headless runs** | Use the same signed-in Codex provider for one-shot DSH tasks that print their answer and exit |

These capabilities reuse the same local ChatGPT sign-in. Subscription routing failures stay visible and never silently switch to another paid route.

## Prepare DSH

This plugin supports the latest DeepSeek Harness release recorded in its package metadata and requires a ChatGPT account that currently has Codex access.

- Do not want to configure Node.js? Use [DSH-Portable](https://github.com/WSL043/DSH-Portable), a community portable desktop distribution for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Prefer the official route? Follow the [DeepSeek Harness run guide](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness#run).

## Install

### Standard DSH command

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-codex-subscription
```

DSH owns target selection, profile locking, dependency resolution, and bundle activation; this is the plugin's only installation path.

### Headless

After signing in and selecting a Codex model in Web once, install the same plugin in DSH's standard Headless profile:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile headless add dsh-codex-subscription
dsh --profile headless "Reply with only the word: ok"
```

<details>
<summary>Official npm route (Node.js installed)</summary>

The official `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web` command does not create a global `dsh` command. Keep the full `npx` prefix when installing the plugin:

```sh
npx -y @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.2-rc.1 plugin --profile web add dsh-codex-subscription
npx -y @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.2-rc.1 plugin --profile web list dsh-codex-subscription --depth 0
npx -y @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.2-rc.1 --profile web --dump-config
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>An existing <code>dsh</code> command</summary>

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-codex-subscription
dsh plugin --profile web list dsh-codex-subscription --depth 0
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

The plugin list should contain one `dsh-codex-subscription`, and the config should contain one `codex-subscription` entry.

</details>

Restart DSH manually after installation, then:

1. Open **Settings -> Codex**.
2. Sign in with a ChatGPT account that has Codex access.
3. Choose a search source.
4. Select a Codex model.

## Features

- ChatGPT OAuth sign-in with credentials kept on the host; accounts are identified by a privacy-masked email that can be clicked to reveal, and can be manually added, switched, or removed without automatic rotation or quota pooling;
- Codex models and Beta image generation/editing directly inside DSH conversations;
- A clear global choice between DSH default search and Codex subscription search; it applies to every model and session rather than following the selected model;
- Actual backend-provided quota, reset time, and freshness;
- Separate standard Codex, Codex-Spark, Credits, and other independent limits;
- One row per available quota reset with its disclosed name and expiry, plus deliberate early redemption, layered confirmation, and no automatic retry;
- Optional percentage, progress bar, or Beta runway estimate for the selected Codex model (off by default);
- Standard or Fast mode for supported Codex models directly in the composer;
- Standard, Extended, and per-model Custom context windows; Custom accepts a full numeric token count, stays within each audited model capacity, and feeds DSH's native agent compaction policy;
- A copyable support report and direct feedback link in Settings; the report includes bounded request stages, HTTP/transport classes, elapsed ranges, and route source types while excluding OAuth credentials, account identifiers, proxy addresses, and authorization timestamps;
- Visible errors when subscription routing is unavailable, with no silent paid fallback.

The plugin can follow an existing HTTPS proxy from the process environment or operating-system proxy settings for official OpenAI and ChatGPT requests. It does not provide a proxy, relay, node list, or system-proxy configuration.

### GPT-6 Astra context

When the official model catalog exposes GPT-6 Astra, Standard preserves the catalog window, Extended uses 872000 tokens, and Custom accepts 128000–872000 tokens (initially 272000). This limit follows the [official Codex model catalog](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/6af345407d9c2a568da9d01b6c4b81a9e61495c0/codex-rs/models-manager/models.json#L33-L34), not the API model's total context capacity. These settings only adjust DSH's local context budget; they do not grant model access or guarantee an account's server-side capacity. Actual availability remains subject to the service.

### Composer quota

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WSL043/dsh-codex-subscription/main/docs/assets/composer-quota-en.png" width="800" alt="Codex quota inside the composer">
</p>

Choose Off, Percent, Progress bar, or Beta Runway in Settings. The compact display appears only for a selected Codex model. Runway is opt-in and estimates pace only from official remaining-percentage observations. It needs at least three samples; sustained high use usually produces a range in 5–10 minutes, while low use takes longer or reports a stable state. Non-sensitive observations from the last 24 hours are kept locally so calibration can continue after restart; a quota reset, account switch, or disabling the feature starts a new calibration period.
The composer shows each returned quota window with its duration. When Plus returns both five-hour and weekly limits, both are visible. Spark keeps its independent quota. Accounts with only a weekly window still show only that window; the plugin does not invent a
five-hour limit, Credits, or spending caps that the service did not return.

### Safe quota reset

If ChatGPT reports available quota resets, Settings shows each one in its own compact row with its disclosed name and expiry.
You may deliberately try it before a quota reaches 100%, which is useful for a reset nearing expiry. ChatGPT still
decides whether a window needs resetting and may return **nothing to reset** without spending the reset. The final
action requires an acknowledgement checkbox and five-second cooldown. Cancel never consumes a reset, rapid repeated
clicks are single-flight, and an uncertain network result is never retried automatically.

### Image generation and editing (Beta)

A basic viewer derived from `dsh-image-viewer` is now built in, with no extra installation required. Plugin-generated image cards use the built-in viewer to keep annotation and continue-editing actions available. You can zoom, pan, fit, add region notes, and download the image. The standard **Download** action retrieves the permission- and integrity-checked exact original by default; only legacy sessions without an exact original fall back to the conversation preview.

New and edited images return the exact original path on the current DSH host in the tool result, so a model or Agent can read or copy the file. The path is on the host running DSH, not a browser download link; original downloads remain session-authorized. Uninstalling the plugin does not delete generated originals.

**Continue editing in composer** does not send automatically. With annotations, it attaches the clean source and a numbered location-reference image, and includes matching numbers, coordinates, notes, and instructions to exclude the markers from the result. Without annotations, it attaches only the opened image. Every marker needs a note; reference preparation failures stop the handoff. Press **Enter** to save and collapse a region note; use **Shift+Enter** for a new line. Notes remain available when the same image is reopened during the current DSH page session.

A new image request does not silently include earlier images. GPT Image 2 can take longer than a normal text turn, and detailed text, exact composition, or repeated-character consistency may still need another pass.

</p>

The screenshot above illustrates image viewing and on-image notes; available buttons can vary with the image and installed viewer version.

### Composer speed

With a supported Codex model selected, open the composer's model menu to choose Standard or Fast.
Standard adds no icon; only Fast shows a lightning icon before the model name. Spark does not show the speed entry. Fast mode increases speed and uses more Credits;
see the [OpenAI Codex Speed documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/speed) for the current rules.

## Update and uninstall

### Update and verify

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web update dsh-codex-subscription
dsh plugin --profile web list dsh-codex-subscription --depth 0
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

### Uninstall

Run this only when you want to remove the plugin:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-codex-subscription
```

These operations preserve the DSH profile, other plugins, and saved sign-in.

### Update and verify

```sh
npx -y @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.2-rc.1 plugin --profile web update dsh-codex-subscription
npx -y @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.2-rc.1 plugin --profile web list dsh-codex-subscription --depth 0
npx -y @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.2-rc.1 --profile web --dump-config
```

### Uninstall

```sh
npx -y @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.2-rc.1 plugin --profile web remove dsh-codex-subscription
```

</details>

## Troubleshooting

- **`dsh` is not recognized:** the official npm route does not create a global `dsh` command; use the complete `npx -y @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.2-rc.1 ...` command above;
- **More than one DSH exists:** run the standard command from the intended DSH environment so that product selects the corresponding profile;
- **Setup still fails:** confirm the command is running in the intended DSH environment. Do not delete the profile or change the system PATH to force an install.
- **Need to report a problem:** generate a **Support diagnostics** report at the bottom of Settings, then open the [bug report form](https://github.com/WSL043/dsh-codex-subscription/issues/new?template=install-problem.yml). The report includes the OS/runtime, bounded sign-in phase, and safe request-failure categories, but excludes credentials, account identifiers, proxy addresses, raw responses, and full logs. Paste it into the required diagnostics field; never attach sign-in URLs, authorization codes, or browser callback addresses.
